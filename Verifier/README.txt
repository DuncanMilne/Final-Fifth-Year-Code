This verifies if a maze scores as expected. Some maze files are included in the "mazes" folder.

Run with:

java Verifier <size> <mazefile> <expected score>

e.g. java Verifier mazes/13x13best.txt 36316

Note: A much better verifier was found in the comments on Kongregate and is shown in the "Better Verifier" folder. Simply run the .exe.
