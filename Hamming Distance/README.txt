The incumbent solution provided by Enright and Faben is hardcoded into an array in these files.

A useful, simple modification would be for the files to parse a file instead.

Mazes are currently set to print if they score over 35,500.

HammingDistanceFiveBFS.java will evaluate all mazes within Hamming Distance 5 and check feasibility with the BFS technique.

HammingDistanceFive.java will use the max steps technique to assess feasibility and evaluate all mazes within Hamming Distance 5. The max steps currently set is 50,000 which can be changed by editing the Java files.

The above two lines are true when changing Five for Four or Three.
